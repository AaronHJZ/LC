# Algorithm Practice for myself.
I'm a father of 2 kids, I need more more money to support my family,
and I was told that being a programmer earns a way lot,
so I'm looking forward to make a living by being a programmer,
and this repo is the beginning.

(All algorithm problems are from leetcode, thanks for leetcode.)
